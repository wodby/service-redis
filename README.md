## Use this service

Use this service through [Redis application stack](https://github.com/wodby/stack-redis), or reference `redis` from a custom
Wodby stack.

A service is a reusable component and does not deploy by itself. The stack
defines its links, settings, versions, resources, and relationship to the rest
of the application.

## Maintain a custom version

1. Fork this repository.
2. Edit the service manifest and referenced files.
3. Import the repository as a [Git-backed service](https://wodby.com/docs/2.0/services/create/#create-a-git-backed-service).
4. Reference the service from a stack manifest.

Keep service, workload, container, endpoint, link, volume, config, and
derivative names stable unless dependent stacks and app-level overrides are
updated at the same time.

Validate the manifests with:

```bash
wodby service validate-manifest service.yml --org <org-id>
```

See the [service manifest reference](https://wodby.com/docs/2.0/services/template/) and the [managed services index](https://github.com/wodby/services).
